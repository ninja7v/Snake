📃 INSTRUCTIONS
============
## 🚀Execution
Snake uses the folowing Pascal units:
- [Crt](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Crt)
- [Dos](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/dos/index.html)
- [Keyboard](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/keyboard/index.html)
- [Sysutils](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/index.html)

To execute it, compile the _snake.pas_ file and run it. After launching the program, a terminal windows pops up.

## ⚙️Menu

Everything happens in the terminal. Select the option you want using ↑ and ↓ arrows (or '8' and '2' keys if the **VERR NUM** buton is desactivated), then press **SPACE BAR** to validate. Any other key won't do anything.
